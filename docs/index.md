# Abstract

Since all the current auto-feeders on the market cannot detect the remaining food in the bowl before the next feed time. We decided to use a load module or an image recognition AI to determine the remaining food's amount. So that this auto-feeder can dynamically adjust the feed amount of food each time based on how much food remainng in the bowl.
